The aim of this project is to create a custom video player which can be implemented in live websites by including 
<script src=github.com/mr0cket/vidjs/script.js></script> in the <head> of the .html file
and including 
<div id="vidjs-container" video="video_location"><div>
in the position you want the video player to sit on your webpage.
